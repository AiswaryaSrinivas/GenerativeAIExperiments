      "This is my first Harley Davidson bike. I have been waiting for the last 2 years for a budget-friendly and luxury-looking cruiser bike. This fits my expectations very well. Service should be done after 10000 km or every one year. Always take a service from the agency for the betterment of the bike. Overall performance is awesome.\n",
      "Buying experience was good as it was from the Harley showroom, in Hyderabad. I booked for the top end but as it was taking more time to get delivery took the vivid model, which is the value-for-money model. \n",
      "The riding experience is superb, it's already been 1 month and 500km I am using it but still searching for opportunities to ride my bike again and again. The power and torque are just wow. I ride mostly in the Hyderabad city traffic but my experience is very good. Easy to handle even in traffic. And that quick maneuver when the signal opens is superb.\n",
      "The looks and build quality is very good. One thing is the wire/cable management would have been better. The front riding handle cable as well as the cable that went to the rear wheel brake mechanism could have been better quality. The mirror is not sufficient for the rearview. \n",
      "Handling is very good and the break performance is very good.\n",
      "Not yet done the first service.\n",
      "Compared to RE, which will cost you 3L onroad, it gives the same 15year engine with cosmetic changes with different color options we can go for X440 with some 50K additional for the improved and powerful engine 440cc, 27bhp with 38NM torque. All LED light setup with beautiful looks and signature DRL and projector lamp.\n",
      "Harley-Davidson X440 is a powerful motorcycle with a comfortable seating position and a refined, ergonomic design. Performance The X440 is powerful and responsive. Handling The X440 is easy to handle and stable at high speed. The X440 has an assist and slipper clutch. There are a few things for make the x440 the best bike.\n",
      "Very convenient experience, staff were very helpful. Great and  Comfortable, torque and power are very, recommended as compared to torque and handling. Slim decent look, charming personality, and performance are also very impressive with their looks. Compatible friendly services at the service station, maintaining is cheaper as you get used to it. It gives a very good personality, speed, power, and handling is awesome, compatible mileage. I think it is a kind of lightweight as a brand company it should be much bulkier.\n",
      "It's a very good bike for riding. It's also good for a long journey. When it comes to performance, the x440 delivers without compromise; whether cruising on highways or tackling challenging corners, it offers unmatched power and responsiveness.

I have been waiting for the last 2 years for a budget-friendly and luxury-looking cruiser bike. This fits my expectations very well. Service should be done after 10000 km or every one year. Always take a service from the agency for the betterment of the bike. Overall performance is awesome.\\nBuying experience was good as it was from the Harley showroom, in Hyderabad. I booked for the top end but as it was taking more time to get delivery took the vivid model, which is the value-for-money model. \\nThe riding experience is superb, it's already been 1 month and 500km I am using it but still searching for opportunities to ride my bike again and again. The power and torque are just wow. I ride mostly in the Hyderabad city traffic but my experience is very good. Easy to handle even in traffic. And that quick maneuver when the signal opens is superb.\\nThe looks and build quality is very good. One thing is the wire/cable management would have been better. The front riding handle cable as well as the cable that went to the rear wheel brake mechanism could have been better quality. The mirror is not sufficient for the rearview. \\nHandling is very good and the break performance is very good.\\nNot yet done the first service.\\nCompared to RE, which will cost you 3L onroad, it gives the same 15year engine with cosmetic changes with different color options we can go for X440 with some 50K additional for the improved and powerful engine 440cc, 27bhp with 38NM torque.

There are a few things for make the x440 the best bike.\\nVery convenient experience, staff were very helpful. Great and  Comfortable, torque and power are very, recommended as compared to torque and handling. Slim decent look, charming personality, and performance are also very impressive with their looks. Compatible friendly services at the service station, maintaining is cheaper as you get used to it. It gives a very good personality, speed, power, and handling is awesome, compatible mileage. I think it is a kind of lightweight as a brand company it should be much bulkier.\\nIt's a very good bike for riding. It's also good for a long journey.

I have been waiting for the last 2 years for a budget-friendly and luxury-looking cruiser bike. This fits my expectations very well. Service should be done after 10000 km or every one year. Always take a service from the agency for the betterment of the bike. Overall performance is awesome.\\nBuying experience was good as it was from the Harley showroom, in Hyderabad. I booked for the top end but as it was taking more time to get delivery took the vivid model, which is the value-for-money model. \\nThe riding experience is superb, it\\'s already been 1 month and 500km I am using it but still searching for opportunities to ride my bike again and again. The power and torque are just wow. I ride mostly in the Hyderabad city traffic but my experience is very good. Easy to handle even in traffic. And that quick maneuver when the signal opens is superb.\\nThe looks and build quality is very good. One thing is the wire/cable management would have been better. The front riding handle cable as well as the cable that went to the rear wheel brake mechanism could have been better quality. The mirror is not sufficient for the rearview. \\nHandling is very good and the break performance is very good.\\nNot yet done the first service.\\nCompared to RE, which will cost you 3L onroad, it gives the same 15year engine with cosmetic changes with different color options we can go for X440 with some 50K additional for the improved and powerful engine 440cc, 27bhp with 38NM torque. All LED light setup with beautiful looks and signature DRL and projector lamp.\\nHarley-Davidson X440 is a powerful motorcycle with a comfortable seating position and a refined, ergonomic design. Performance The X440 is powerful and responsive. Handling The X440 is easy to handle and stable at high speed. The X440 has an assist and slipper clutch. There are a few things for make the x440 the best bike.\\nVery convenient experience, staff were very helpful. Great and  Comfortable, torque and power are very, recommended as compared to torque and handling. Slim decent look, charming personality, and performance are also very impressive with their looks. Compatible friendly services at the service station, maintaining is cheaper as you get used to it. It gives a very good personality, speed, power, and handling is awesome, compatible mileage. I think it is a kind of lightweight as a brand company it should be much bulkier.\\nIt\\'s a very good bike for riding. It\\'s also good for a long journey. When it comes to performance, the x440 delivers without compromise; whether cruising on highways or tackling challenging corners, it offers unmatched power and responsiveness. In conclusion, owning a Harley Davidson x440 truly embodies the spirit of biking excellence coupled with an exceptional buying experience.\\nI bought the Harley Davidson X440 S variant. I got this delivered on 26th October. And have driven in Bangalore traffic conditions as well as taken it out.\\nBuying Experience:\\nThe buying experience was good and the Harley staff behaviour was very nice.\\nRiding Experience :\\nThis is the most unexpected part. I have driven a splendour before this for 6 years and was afraid that in traffic, I would have to struggle. But I was blown away by the handling of this motorcycle. Once u have switched it on, you don\\'t feel the weight. The motorcycle was able to easily come out of traffic.\\nThe response of the bike is amazing, and as soon as you pull the accelerator, you feel the power. And for one long trip I did, this bike feels amazing on the 5th and 6th gear. A relaxed effortless cruising experience. \\nPros :\\n1. Great Handing\\n2. Smooth Cruising Experience\\n3. Great throttle response\\n4. Eye-catching, absolutely stunning-looking bike\\n5. Road Presence \\n6. Great suspension\\nDream bike for me, have no other experience with this bike but its look and performance look quite awesome with modern technology.\\nIt weighs less than the Royal Enfield classic and its performance is better than RE.\\nThe sound is lovable as heard in the video review just eagerly waiting for that day when I own this real road king.\\nLooks awesome like a typical HarleySound feels great and the seating position looks promising. I am going for this bike. It\\'s definitely the best among the rivals in all aspects. \\nThough the engine is made by Hero, I don\\'t see any hero are much more durable and less maintained. \\nWhat else do we need.. its a perfect motorcycle to go for all age groups.\\nThe pricing of the base variant is good. But lack in features like navigation,gear indicators,traction control,only air cooling system.  But the ergonomics seems good . The ride will be comfortable. Harley provides lcd display but no navigation no connectivity features etc. But harley didn\\'t overpriced it. I think it\\'s a value for money. At least it is a Harley Davidson . In the books they claim that this bike gets 35 km mileage,that is a decent mileage\\nFirstly the bike was excellent good milage the engine capacity was soo good in this budget soo good experience in riding this bike good performance excellent milage use tube less tyres for vloggers and riders for tours after the service bike was so fresh like a showroom bike it was soo good bike I have ever seen\\nAmazing bike from harley and hero collaboration.With both front and rear disc brakes, Harley-Davidson X440 comes up with anti-locking braking system. This X440 bike weighs 190.5 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 13.5 liters.2.29 Lakh and goes upto Rs. 2.69 Lakh. Harley Davidson X440 is offered in 3 variants - Denim, Vivid and the top variant X440 S which comes at a price tag of Rs. 2.69 Lakh.\\nGreat experience i recently purchased this bike and my riding experience is very out standing wow wow wow harley davidson it\\'s sports bike ilove this bike looks premium and sharap performance is okay not a great but one thing is milega is very low and service and maintenance charges is higher than other normal bikes but it\\'s not major things for sports bike lovers and iam fully satisfied with this bike and recommend this bike for purchase all people from india great experience harley davidson top speed is 130❤️❤️🥰🥰\\nWaited for 3 month to get this product launch and now even after launch delivery dates are of october.\\nThis is really bad marketing. Why to launch a bike in so much advance when it\\'s not available to deliver and also there is no bike available for display or test ride. Who wants to book a bike worth 3 lakh without sitting on it taking a nearby look.\\nFinally i bought honda h\\'ness cb350 and happy with my purchase .\\nFully comfortable to ride for 400-500 Km and the bike mileage is normal the bike Bike is very good and the price is satisfactory. I really loved this Harley Davidson x440.  its competitors especially better than Royal Enfield Classic 350, Triumph Speed 400, Royal Enfield Hunter 350, etc. I will definitely buy this bike for sure.\\nHarley is a dream for all indians and in this price range wah from all indians, this bike will be one of the best segments in the indian bikes category, look and rate are almost unique. At the outset, i have to admit that i admire harley-davidson for their new approach to motorcycles. For a manufacturer that’s steeped in history with big, air-cooled v-twin powered bikes dominating their portfolio, and to some extent their identity, the new line of harley-davidson motorcycles represent their efforts of moving with the times.\\nI don\\'t buy this bike.... But I will but it definitely if my budget is upto 2.5 lakh. It is best among all of its competitors especially better then Royal Enfield\\nHarley-davidson has a better brand value then Royal Enfield it\\'s like to buy a I phone instead of samsung. One day I will definitely buy this bike for sure\\nThis bike is very first bike introduced by Harley Davidson in India. I hope this bike will not disappoint us. Another reason to love this bike is that this bike is gonna be super cool and the looks of this bike is very awesome 👍  at last I just want to say that I really loved this Harley davidson x440\\nBike is very good and the price is satisfactory the bike mileage is normal the bike suspension is gorgeous I love this bike\\'s sound you will buy this bike the tyre and suspension is good  and the bike engine  is very powerful engine the gears 5 gears it\\'s very good bike in this price\\nGreat to bring this model to my country. people will accept this motor cycle. Really it will going to grab the India roads .bike looks good.hero and harley David son both companies will hit the market by giving this motor cycle and it\\'s dream to buy this motor cycle for best price and I\\'m going to buy this as soon as possible and it\\'s my dream\\nPros:\\nRiding experience was awesome. The comfort is great. The exhaust note is just WOW! This bike is a blend of modern as well as retro. Amazing features like auto glow headlamps and Harley badging on the headlamp. \\nCons:\\nThe gap between the fuel tank and the headlamp area seems a bit empty from the side profile. \\nSuspensions could have been much better for bumpy rides.\\nThe buying experience was fantastic. I got this on the first day of x440 delivery that too first bike owned by SR Nagar Bhanu Automobiles. There were regional managers present from Harley-Davidson, it was a great feeling.\\nThe bike was amazing in its looks the sound was mind-blowing and the pickup was beyond my expectations.\"\\n<|assistant|>\\nBased on the customer testimonials and product description provided, here\\'s my response:\\n\\nOverall, customers who have purchased the Harley Davidson x440 are highly satisfied with their buying experience and riding performance.

The ride will be comfortable. Harley provides lcd display but no navigation no connectivity features etc. But harley didn't overpriced it. I think it's a value for money.

    "Harley is a dream for all indians and in this price range wah from all indians, this bike will be one of the best segments in the indian bikes category, look and rate are almost unique. At the outset, i have to admit that i admire harley-davidson for their new approach to motorcycles. For a manufacturer that’s steeped in history with big, air-cooled v-twin powered bikes dominating their portfolio, and to some extent their identity, the new line of harley-davidson motorcycles represent their efforts of moving with the times.\n",
    "I don't buy this bike.... But I will but it definitely if my budget is upto 2.5 lakh. It is best among all of its competitors especially better then Royal Enfield\n",

In the books they claim that this bike gets 35 km mileage,that is a decent mileage\\nFirstly the bike was excellent good milage the engine capacity was soo good in this budget soo good experience in riding this bike good performance excellent milage use tube less tyres for vloggers and riders for tours after the service bike was so fresh like a showroom bike it was soo good bike I have ever seen\\nAmazing bike from harley and hero collaboration.With both front and rear disc brakes, Harley-Davidson X440 comes up with anti-locking braking system. This X440 bike weighs 190.5 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 13.5 liters.2.29 Lakh and goes upto Rs. 2.69 Lakh. Harley Davidson X440 is offered in 3 variants - Denim, Vivid and the top variant X440 S which comes at a price tag of Rs. 2.69 Lakh.\\nGreat experience i recently purchased this bike and my riding experience is very out standing wow wow wow harley davidson it's sports bike ilove this bike looks premium and sharap performance is okay not a great but one thing is milega is very low and service and maintenance charges is higher than other normal bikes but it's not major things for sports bike lovers and iam fully satisfied with this bike and recommend this bike for purchase all people from india great experience harley davidson top speed is 130❤️❤️🥰🥰\\nWaited for 3 month to get this product launch and now even after launch delivery dates are of october.\\nThis is really bad marketing. Why to launch a bike in so much advance when it's not available to deliver and also there is no bike available for display or test ride. Who wants to book a bike worth 3 lakh without sitting on it taking a nearby look.\\nFinally i bought honda h'ness cb350 and happy with my purchase .\\nFully comfortable to ride for 400-500 Km and the bike mileage is normal the bike Bike is very good and the price is satisfactory. I really loved this Harley Davidson x440.  its competitors especially better than Royal Enfield Classic 350, Triumph Speed 400, Royal Enfield Hunter 350, etc. I will definitely buy this bike for sure.\\nHarley is a dream for all indians and in this price range wah from all indians, this bike will be one of the best segments in the indian bikes category, look and rate are almost unique. At the outset, i have to admit that i admire harley-davidson for their new approach to motorcycles. For a manufacturer that’s steeped in history with big, air-cooled v-twin powered bikes dominating their portfolio, and to some extent their identity, the new line of harley-davidson motorcycles represent their efforts of moving with the times.\\nI don't buy this bike.... But I will but it definitely if my budget is upto 2.5 lakh. It is best among all of its competitors especially better then Royal Enfield\\nHarley-davidson has a better brand value then Royal Enfield it's like to buy a I phone instead of samsung. One day I will definitely buy this bike for sure\\nThis bike is very first bike introduced by Harley Davidson in India. I hope this bike will not disappoint us. Another reason to love this bike is that this bike is gonna be super cool and the looks of this bike is very awesome 👍  at last I just want to say that I really loved this Harley davidson x440\\nBike is very good and the price is satisfactory the bike mileage is normal the bike suspension is gorgeous I love this bike's sound you will buy this bike the tyre and suspension is good  and the bike engine  is very powerful engine the gears 5 gears it's very good bike in this price\\nGreat to bring this model to my country. people will accept this motor cycle. Really it will going to grab the India roads .bike looks good.hero and harley David son both companies will hit the market by giving this motor cycle and it's dream to buy this motor cycle for best price and I'm going to buy this as soon as possible and it's my dream\\nPros:\\nRiding experience was awesome. The comfort is great. The exhaust note is just WOW! This bike is a blend of modern as well as retro. Amazing features like auto glow headlamps and Harley badging on the headlamp. \\nCons:\\nThe gap between the fuel tank and the headlamp area seems a bit empty from the side profile. \\nSuspensions could have been much better for bumpy rides.\\nThe buying experience was fantastic. I got this on the first day of x440 delivery that too first bike owned by SR Nagar Bhanu Automobiles. There were regional managers present from Harley-Davidson, it was a great feeling.\\nThe bike was amazing in its looks the sound was mind-blowing and the pickup was beyond my expectations.<|assistant|>\\nOverall, the Harley Davidson x440 is an exceptional motorcycle that delivers on performance, style, and value for money.

      "This is my first Harley Davidson bike. I have been waiting for the last 2 years for a budget-friendly and luxury-looking cruiser bike. This fits my expectations very well. Service should be done after 10000 km or every one year. Always take a service from the agency for the betterment of the bike. Overall performance is awesome.\n",
      "Buying experience was good as it was from the Harley showroom, in Hyderabad. I booked for the top end but as it was taking more time to get delivery took the vivid model, which is the value-for-money model. \n",
      "The riding experience is superb, it's already been 1 month and 500km I am using it but still searching for opportunities to ride my bike again and again. The power and torque are just wow. I ride mostly in the Hyderabad city traffic but my experience is very good. Easy to handle even in traffic. And that quick maneuver when the signal opens is superb.\n",
      "The looks and build quality is very good. One thing is the wire/cable management would have been better. The front riding handle cable as well as the cable that went to the rear wheel brake mechanism could have been better quality. The mirror is not sufficient for the rearview. \n",
      "Handling is very good and the break performance is very good.\n",
      "Not yet done the first service.\n",
      "Compared to RE, which will cost you 3L onroad, it gives the same 15year engine with cosmetic changes with different color options we can go for X440 with some 50K additional for the improved and powerful engine 440cc, 27bhp with 38NM torque. All LED light setup with beautiful looks and signature DRL and projector lamp.\n",
      "Harley-Davidson X440 is a powerful motorcycle with a comfortable seating position and a refined, ergonomic design. Performance The X440 is powerful and responsive. Handling The X440 is easy to handle and stable at high speed. The X440 has an assist and slipper clutch. There are a few things for make the x440 the best bike.\n",
      "Very convenient experience, staff were very helpful. Great and  Comfortable, torque and power are very, recommended as compared to torque and handling. Slim decent look, charming personality, and performance are also very impressive with their looks. Compatible friendly services at the service station, maintaining is cheaper as you get used to it. It gives a very good personality, speed, power, and handling is awesome, compatible mileage. I think it is a kind of lightweight as a brand company it should be much bulkier.\n",
      "It's a very good bike for riding. It's also good for a long journey. When it comes to performance, the x440 delivers without compromise; whether cruising on highways or tackling challenging corners, it offers unmatched power and responsiveness. In conclusion, owning a Harley Davidson x440 truly embodies the spirit of biking excellence coupled with an exceptional buying experience.\n",
      "I bought the Harley Davidson X440 S variant. I got this delivered on 26th October. And have driven in Bangalore traffic conditions as well as taken it out.\n",
      "Buying Experience:\n",
      "The buying experience was good and the Harley staff behaviour was very nice.\n",
      "Riding Experience :\n",
      "This is the most unexpected part. I have driven a splendour before this for 6 years and was afraid that in traffic, I would have to struggle. But I was blown away by the handling of this motorcycle. Once u have switched it on, you don't feel the weight. The motorcycle was able to easily come out of traffic.\n",
      "The response of the bike is amazing, and as soon as you pull the accelerator, you feel the power. And for one long trip I did, this bike feels amazing on the 5th and 6th gear. A relaxed effortless cruising experience. \n",
      "Pros :\n",
      "1. Great Handing\n",
      "2. Smooth Cruising Experience\n",
      "3. Great throttle response\n",
      "4. Eye-catching, absolutely stunning-looking bike\n",
      "5. Road Presence \n",
      "6. Great suspension\n",
      "Dream bike for me, have no other experience with this bike but its look and performance look quite awesome with modern technology.\n",
      "It weighs less than the Royal Enfield classic and its performance is better than RE.\n",
      "The sound is lovable as heard in the video review just eagerly waiting for that day when I own this real road king.\n",
      "Looks awesome like a typical HarleySound feels great and the seating position looks promising. I am going for this bike. It's definitely the best among the rivals in all aspects. \n",
      "Though the engine is made by Hero, I don't see any hero are much more durable and less maintained. \n",
      "What else do we need.. its a perfect motorcycle to go for all age groups.\n",
      "The pricing of the base variant is good. But lack in features like navigation,gear indicators,traction control,only air cooling system.  But the ergonomics seems good . The ride will be comfortable. Harley provides lcd display but no navigation no connectivity features etc. But harley didn't overpriced it. I think it's a value for money. At least it is a Harley Davidson . In the books they claim that this bike gets 35 km mileage,that is a decent mileage\n",
      "Firstly the bike was excellent good milage the engine capacity was soo good in this budget soo good experience in riding this bike good performance excellent milage use tube less tyres for vloggers and riders for tours after the service bike was so fresh like a showroom bike it was soo good bike I have ever seen\n",
      "Amazing bike from harley and hero collaboration.With both front and rear disc brakes, Harley-Davidson X440 comes up with anti-locking braking system. This X440 bike weighs 190.5 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 13.5 liters.2.29 Lakh and goes upto Rs. 2.69 Lakh. Harley Davidson X440 is offered in 3 variants - Denim, Vivid and the top variant X440 S which comes at a price tag of Rs. 2.69 Lakh.\n",
      "Great experience i recently purchased this bike and my riding experience is very out standing wow wow wow harley davidson it's sports bike ilove this bike looks premium and sharap performance is okay not a great but one thing is milega is very low and service and maintenance charges is higher than other normal bikes but it's not major things for sports bike lovers and iam fully satisfied with this bike and recommend this bike for purchase all people from india great experience harley davidson top speed is 130❤️❤️🥰🥰\n",
      "Waited for 3 month to get this product launch and now even after launch delivery dates are of october.\n",
      "This is really bad marketing. Why to launch a bike in so much advance when it's not available to deliver and also there is no bike available for display or test ride. Who wants to book a bike worth 3 lakh without sitting on it taking a nearby look.\n",
      "Finally i bought honda h'ness cb350 and happy with my purchase .\n",
      "Fully comfortable to ride for 400-500 Km and the bike mileage is normal the bike Bike is very good and the price is satisfactory. I really loved this Harley Davidson x440.  its competitors especially better than Royal Enfield Classic 350, Triumph Speed 400, Royal Enfield Hunter 350, etc. I will definitely buy this bike for sure.\n",
      "Harley is a dream for all indians and in this price range wah from all indians, this bike will be one of the best segments in the indian bikes category, look and rate are almost unique. At the outset, i have to admit that i admire harley-davidson for their new approach to motorcycles. For a manufacturer that’s steeped in history with big, air-cooled v-twin powered bikes dominating their portfolio, and to some extent their identity, the new line of harley-davidson motorcycles represent their efforts of moving with the times.\n",
      "I don't buy this bike.... But I will but it definitely if my budget is upto 2.5 lakh. It is best among all of its competitors especially better then Royal Enfield\n",
      "Harley-davidson has a better brand value then Royal Enfield it's like to buy a I phone instead of samsung. One day I will definitely buy this bike for sure\n",
      "This bike is very first bike introduced by Harley Davidson in India. I hope this bike will not disappoint us. Another reason to love this bike is that this bike is gonna be super cool and the looks of this bike is very awesome 👍  at last I just want to say that I really loved this Harley davidson x440\n",
      "Bike is very good and the price is satisfactory the bike mileage is normal the bike suspension is gorgeous I love this bike's sound you will buy this bike the tyre and suspension is good  and the bike engine  is very powerful engine the gears 5 gears it's very good bike in this price\n",
      "Great to bring this model to my country. people will accept this motor cycle. Really it will going to grab the India roads .bike looks good.hero and harley David son both companies will hit the market by giving this motor cycle and it's dream to buy this motor cycle for best price and I'm going to buy this as soon as possible and it's my dream\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "Riding experience was awesome. The comfort is great. The exhaust note is just WOW! This bike is a blend of modern as well as retro. Amazing features like auto glow headlamps and Harley badging on the headlamp. \n",
